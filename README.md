This is a Java library project which contains some tool classes to deal with
collections of Java objects. Collections are container objects that are there
to keep serveral objects of the same type together, such as lists, vectors,
arrays, hash tables etc.

Java comes with a valuable variety of collections, so this package is only a
tiny add-on to all of these.
