/**
 * Compares two sorted sets in a very performing manner.
 * <p>
 * Often, two collections are compared by making a copy of the first, and
 * removing all elements from the second from it.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Collection firstOnly = new ArrayList<>(first);
 * firstOnly.removeAll(second);
 * </pre>
 *
 * If both margins are needed, the same is done for the other side. This works,
 * but given your sets are sorted anyway (maybe ID lists returned from a
 * database), there is a much faster performing way to get this done.
 * <p>
 * Parallel traversal works in constant time (O(ùëõ)), even for very large sets.
 * <p>
 * This class implements functionality for comparing <i>two</i> sorted sets,
 * where you typically have a conceptual ‚Äúleft side‚Äù and ‚Äúright side‚Äù.
